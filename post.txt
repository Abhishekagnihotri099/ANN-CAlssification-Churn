🚀 Proud to share a breakthrough we’ve been working on! 🚀
We’ve successfully built a GenAI-enabled Data Retrieval Utility that simplifies complex data access through natural language queries. 💬⚙️
This utility eliminates the dependency on hardcoded SQL and Python joins, enabling dynamic, on-the-fly query generation and significantly reducing turnaround time for data requests. It empowers teams to:
✅ Use plain language to generate tailored SQL queries

✅ Avoid deep SQL/Python debugging

✅ Replace static query templates with real-time LLM-generated SQL

✅ Retrieve fully joined and decrypted data — all in one step!
This innovation was made possible through the collaborative efforts with Raj 🤝 and the expert guidance and deep domain knowledge of our lead, Utkarsh 🙌. Their support and insight were instrumental in shaping the architecture and bringing this idea to life.
Looking forward to expanding this further across more use cases and sharing detailed results soon!
